	<h2>Things Going on on animal jam:</h2>
	<p>Right in Animal jam before our very eyes betas are starting to come back! As you noticed gazelles are at stores.  </p>
	<p>Also on the Forgotten Desert Eagles all around Jamaa are getting betas from that Adventure! </p>
	<p>People may not know but some of their plant betas are at store, be sure to be looking at the wonderful new castle den! </p>
	<p>In the new castle den there is a mine and a boat, look inside the castle den very closely and you may find a ladder of some sort! :3                                          <img src="images/star.png" width="200" height="200">
